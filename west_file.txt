Mismatches produce a kink which is recognized by the CEL family of endonucleases from
spinach, T4 phage endo VII and T7 phage endo I. This property is used in the Surveyor nuclease
assays to check point mutations and indels and as well as in CRISPR Cas assays to detect indels.
In our assay, cells having putative mutations will be permeabilized and then will be treated with a
judicious combination of the Surveryor /endo VII along with Nuclease P1 (if needed), an ssDNA
endonuclease to locate DNA mismatches (SNPs and indels) and convert them to dsDNA breaks,
