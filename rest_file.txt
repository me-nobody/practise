In cancer cells, Mismatch Repair (MMR) can be switched oﬀ epigenetically, or by mutations or by proteins like YB-1 and HORMAD 1. In fact, a study showed that targeted therapy signals the downregulation of MMR. Shutting down MMR would increase mutagenesis and cause selection of drug resistant clones. Thus, a possibility exists for ﬁnding and targeting pathways which prevent MMR and thus prevent development of drug resistance.
To screen conditions, where MMR is downregulated, it would be desirable to develop an in situ fluorescence assay, to detect the presence of mismatches inside mammalian cells. Such an assay should be inexpensive compared to WGS and can supplement invitro assays.
